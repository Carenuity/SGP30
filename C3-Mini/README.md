## Introduction
The **Air-Quality-Meter** is a plug-and-play device designed to monitor indoor air quality. It uses the SGP30 sensor from Sensirion to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon dioxide (CO2) levels, along with humidity data. The device is built around the C3 Mini microcontroller and features an OLED display for real-time readings. This project is brought to you by Carenuity, offering a free IoT application that simplifies air quality monitoring.
